Crop-Recommendation-System-using-MRFE

Description

Crop cultivation prediction is essential in agriculture, relying on factors like soil quality, environmental conditions (rainfall and temperature), and fertilizer application (Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous). These factors vary regionally, making it challenging to grow the same crop everywhere. Machine Learning (ML) helps by identifying suitable crops for specific regions. 

  This study introduces an innovative ML Feature Selection (FS) approach called Modified Recursive Feature Elimination (MRFE) to extract relevant features for crop prediction. MRFE excels at selecting the most accurate features, and the integrated Voting Ensemble technique combines predictions from multiple models for better accuracy. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score evaluate MRFE's reliability. The system uses a web-based approach to recommend the best crop based on agricultural inputs.
