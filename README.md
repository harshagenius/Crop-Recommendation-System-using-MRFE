# Crop-Recommendation-System-using-MRFE

DESCRIPTION

     Crop cultivation prediction plays a crucial role in agriculture, relying heavily on 
factors like soil quality, environmental conditions such as rainfall and temperature, and the 
applications of fertilizers, particularly Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K) and Phosphorous (P).  
However, these factors exhibit regional variations, making it challenging for farmers to 
cultivate the same crop everywhere. This is where Machine Learning (ML) technique comes 
into play, assisting in determining the most suitable crops for specific regions. This study 
introduces an innovative Feature Selection (FS) approach of ML known as Modified 
Recursive Feature Elimination (MRFE) to extract relevant features from a dataset for crop 
prediction. 
          The MRFE method really stands out in picking the most accurate features for 
predicting crops. The integrated Voting Ensemble technique essentially takes the predictions 
from several different models and combines them to give a more accurate recommendation. 
These include various measures like accuracy (ACC), precision, recall, and F1 score that 
help in evaluating the performance and reliability of the MRFE approach. This system 
introduces a web-based approach that takes various inputs of agriculture factors and 
recommends the crop that best suits under given circumstances.
